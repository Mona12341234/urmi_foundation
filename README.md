A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
We designed a web portal for the urmi foundation to provide Management of the data which was difficult to maintain on
the Excel sheets and Impact analysis for tracking students' progress. This is part of the JPMC code for good event.       
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.                
solutions and features for this project are:                  
Stored the data in a well-structured centralized database           
More teacher-friendly way of manually entering the data.           
Dynamic rendering of graphs for easy data analysis.           
Our future goals are:                     
• Speech enabled form filling               
• Enabling auto-fill of the form from CSV               
• Multilingual access to the dashboard
